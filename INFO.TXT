You are on a mission to help online students around the world to keep learning by displaying relevant information on their learning progress.

Based on the provided data on video usage and problem performance, create a progress summary that shows a student how they're doing in the context of their peers. Here are some questions a student might want to have answered by looking at their “dashboard”:

 - How far am I in the course? What’s still left?
 - How have I engaged with the course?
 - How do I compare to others?
 - What should I do next?
 - Am I on track to reach my goal?
 - An ideal student dashboard would provide information to learners on their progress in course video and problems that might potentially boost their learning engagement.

We encourage participants to try and submit entries, no matter how experimental or basic they are. You could help create better learning experiences for online learners worldwide.

There is research in the field of behavioral economics that motivates this challenge. It has been shown that providing feedback to an individual on how he or she compares to the group of peers affects behavior (Allcott, 2011; Dolan et al., 2012; Tafkov, 2013).

We are also very interested in experimenting with providing suggestions (predictions) on what resources the student may want to (or may have to) engage in next week based on what well-performing peers are doing.

Feel free to answer other questions that may help students understand how they’re doing, and help keep them motivated. You can be liberal in your assumptions (e.g. about what kinds of goals students might report to the system), but please state them in your description.

Think about what would be most useful to online learners to know from the data on their performance and the performance of others, in order to keep them motivated to keep learning. This is the main criterion by which we will be selecting a winner.

All participants rewards:

All submissions are open source, you are helping the community learn how to create dashboards
Your entry will have your name on it, prominently displayed under your profile on Databits (unless you decide to take it off!)
Winner rewards:

We'll use the winning submission as a starting point for the edX student analytics dashboard, and make sure to reference you at the concept author.
We’ll work with you to describe your entry on the edX product and engineering blog.
If you’re in the Boston area or have an opportunity to come to the edX offices, we’ll give you a tour and chat about analytics and visualization, and you will also get to meet performance management and behavioral economics researchers from Harvard Business School.
Finally, we’ll send you an edX T-shirt!
Requirements

We have provided a data set with data about the videos and problems in a course, as well as per-student records of watching videos, attempting problems, and overall time spent on the site.

Use this data to create a visualization aiming to answer question(s) above that you believe are most important.
Allow the user to select a student id from the dataset, to see the data from their perspective.
Show the student’s performance in the context of their peers.
Note: due to a combination of privacy and complexity concerns, this is not real student data – it has been created to roughly match many of the patterns we see in real data, but it is somewhat simplified.


Recommendations
---------------
 - Interactivity — let the student explore the visualization.
 - Clustering — group the students in some way(s), and use the grouping to intelligently reveal information on comparison to other students in an individual’s performance dashboard.
 - Mobile friendliness — anything we actually ship will need to work on phones and tablets.
 - D3 and other packages are acceptable.
